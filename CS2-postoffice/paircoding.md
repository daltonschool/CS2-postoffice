# Main Pair Coding Rules

Your goal is to write better code by having two minds working together. 

1.  A pair is two.  No more, no less.
2.	Respect the two roles: driver and navigator.  The Driver works the computer, writing the code.  The Navigator guides the next move.
3.  Stay active and engaged.  Quiet is a bad sign, the driver is expected to narrate and the navigator is expected to give direction.
4.  Never say trust me.  Work to both understand and agree.
5.	Switch roles at regular intervals.  Use a timer, switch after 7 minutes.

Violations:

* 	working without your partner.
*	asking questions without your partner
*	hitting your partner
